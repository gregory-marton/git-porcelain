# git-porcelain

Wrappers for git and hub that I've found useful. They are likely not
to be bug free, but they've made me reasonably happy so far. There may
also be code here that I've lifted from one place or another. I
usually try to give credit, especially for larger segments, but it's
hard to do for every line one sees on stackoverflow or wherever.

Provided AS-IS. No warranties. Your mileage may vary.

bash ./install.sh -n will show you what it would like to do. If you
want it to do that, then run it without -n.
